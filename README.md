# Paletto

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Execute: `npm install`
4. Execute: `npm run dev`

The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

## Description

**Paletto** is a web application that generates complete color palettes from a single hex color input. You enter any valid hex color code (e.g. `#3a86ff`) and the app produces a full tonal range for that color — from its darkest shades to its lightest tints — using the `values.js` library under the hood.

Each color in the generated palette is displayed as a clickable card showing the hex code and its tonal weight. Clicking any card copies the hex value directly to your clipboard, making it easy to grab colors for use in design tools, CSS, or any other workflow. The text color on each card automatically adapts between light and dark to stay readable regardless of the background brightness.

The interface is intentionally minimal: a single text input and a submit button. Enter your base color, hit "GET COLORS", and the full palette renders instantly. If the input is not a valid hex color, the field highlights with an error state so you know to correct it before trying again.

Paletto is useful for designers and developers who need a quick way to explore the tonal spectrum of a color — whether for building design systems, generating CSS variables, picking accessible contrast pairs, or simply finding the right shade of a color without opening a full design tool.
